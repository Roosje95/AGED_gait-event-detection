# Automatic-gait-event-detection-Codes
Codes and example data connected to Visscher & Sansgiri et al. "Towards validation and standardization of automatic gait event identification algorithms for use
in paediatric pathological populations".
Current version of teh codes uses the hallux instead of toemarker - if you want to adapt replace LHLX/RHLX with LTOE/RTOE.

# Needed to run

btk installed [http://biomechanical-toolkit.github.io/]

Trails_info.xlsx
 
Matlab functions 

To run the codes explained within the article on 3 example c3d files, please download all files and adapth the paths within the Main_Algorithms script.

# Outcomes 
After running the code table1 reports the frame on which event is detected per method, if you want ms instead of frame
